Hello and Welcome!

This Katacoda covers the basics of Parquet and demonstrates it as an example data format for schema-on-write.
But first of all, it is important to understand what Parquet actually is.

> Parquet ist an open source, column-oriented data file format, meaning that, unlike in row-oriented data file formats like CSV, files are organized by column, rather than by row. [1](https://databricks.com/de/glossary/what-is-parquet)

The following illustrations depict what a row- and column-oriented data file format essentially look like.
