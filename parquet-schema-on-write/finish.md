Congratulations to working with your first parquet file!

You learned how to read a CSV file, how to work with it within Pandas and how to use Parquet as a means to implement a simple schema-on-write database.
You have saved the result into an external file, which can be further worked with, and you have seen how this file has a unique schema different from the former CSV file.

These skills serve as a stepping stone for setting up more complex database management systems that can take advantage of the benefits of schema-on-write.

Thanks for taking this Katacoda!
